# War3HD

This project aimed at providing a new custom renderer for the Blizzard classic *Warcraft 3* game by intercepting and replacing the OpenGL DLL used by its renderer.

Basic DLL injection and an ImGui debug UI with simple custom shaders has been implemented but nothing more advanced was done. Now that *Warcraft 3 Reforged* has been released this project is no longer being maintained and I have no itention of continuing work on it.
